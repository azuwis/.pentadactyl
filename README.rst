goo.gl url shortner
====================

Uses an unofficial API so might break any any moment. Google has said they want
to provide an official API for goo.gl, but not there yet.

This is tested and works for Pentadactyl (http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/index). To use it just drop it into your `~/.pentadactyl/plugins/` directory.

Commands
---------

gg
  Shorten the current url and yank to clipboard

googl
  Alias for `gg`

Let me know if things don't work for you.
