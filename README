TabGroupie is a plugin for pentadactyl. It allows you to create tabgroups,
rename them and move the currently use tab from group to group
with pentadactyl.

under constuction:
It works, but if you have any ideas that may improve this plugin let me know.

requires:
Firefox 4.0 (or similar) or higher

install:
Just copy the TabGroupie.js to ~/.pentadactyl/plugins/ (on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\pentadactyl\plugins)
and it will work with these five commands:

    tgroup-change [TARGETGROUPTITLE]
    tgroup-delete [GROUPTITLE]
    tgroup-new [NEWGROUPTITLE]
    tgroup-switch [TARGETGROUPTITLE]
    tgroup-title [NEWTITLE]
after restarting pentadactyl.

uninstall:
Just remove TabGroupie.js from ~/.pentadactyl/plugins (on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\pentadactyl\plugins).

Thanks:
I like to thank Kris Maglione for helping me out with the completion
and my Dad, Thammi, Astro and dodo and all other whos freetime I wasted
for the codereviews and advices.
I learned a lot about JavaScript, Firefox and Pentadactyl.

Have fun with TabGroupie.
